# ERSEM

## Combined branch

Combined branch merges branches dvm and DOC to combine code changes from these two NECCTON developments. In testcases, fabm-neccton-combined.yaml can be used to run ERSEM with NEMO over AMM7 with the code in the combined branch and updated parameterisation for POC and benthic fauna.

[ERSEM](http://ersem.com) is a marine biogeochemical and ecosystem model. It describes the
cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, oxygen and iron through 
the lower trophic level pelagic and benthic ecosystems.

# Support

We strongly encourage everyone using the ERSEM code to register as a user by filling a
[short registration form](https://forms.office.com/r/X0iXv8AvTC). 
We’d love to get a better understanding of who is using the ERSEM code and for what 
applications, as it will help us to provide the best support to the user community. 
It will also allow you to receive information and news on the latest model developments.
