# About ERSEM

![ERSEM diagram](ERSEM.png)

[ERSEM](http://ersem.com) is a marine ecosystem model. It describes the
biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, oxygen and
iron through pelagic and benthic ecosystems. The ecosystem is divided into
functional types, which are further subdivided by traits such as size. In the
pelagic, ERSEM by default distinguishes:

* 4 types of phytoplankton: diatoms, picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton,
  microphytoplankton
* 3 types of zooplankton: nanoflagellates, microzooplankton, mesozooplankon
* bacteria

The benthic system includes:

* 3 types of infauna: meiofauna, suspension feeders, deposit feeders
* 2 types of bacteria: aerobic and anaerobic

In addition, ERSEM tracks the concentrations of phosphate, nitrate, ammonium,
silicate, iron, oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity in the
pelagic and in sediment porewaters. It includes several classes of particulate
and dissolved organic matter in pelagic and sediment. A carbonate system module
calculates pH and calcium carbonate saturation.

Through [FABM](http://fabm.net), ERSEM can be coupled to a wide range of
hydrodynamic models including NEMO, FVCOM, ROMS and GOTM. FABM also makes it
easy to customise the default set of functional types described above, and to
combine ERSEM with modules representing other parts of the ecosystem, including
fish communities, shellfish, seagrass meadows and spectraly resolved irradiance.

# Building 

## Linux

First go to a directory where you want to place the source codes.
This will be referred to as `<SOURCEDIR>` below.

Now get the ERSEM, FABM and GOTM source codes:

    git clone https://github.com/pmlmodelling/ersem.git
    git clone https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm.git
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gotm-model/code.git gotm

This locally creates "gotm", "fabm", "ersem" directories with source code.

Note: the above gets you ERSEM's public stable release. Developers can check
out the the developers' version by substituting
`git@gitlab.ecosystem-modelling.pml.ac.uk:edge/ersem.git` for
`https://github.com/pmlmodelling/ersem.git`.

To build the code, you will need:
* [a recent Fortran compiler](
  https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm/wiki/Building-and-installing#supported-compilers)
* [cmake](https://www.cmake.org) 3.0 or higher. First check whether you have that
  installed: run `cmake --version` on the command line.

### GOTM: ERSEM in a water column

To build GOTM, create a build directory, run `cmake` to generate makefiles, and
run `make` to compile and install. For instance:

    mkdir -p ~/build/gotm
    cd ~/build/gotm
    cmake <SOURCEDIR>/gotm -DFABM_BASE=<SOURCEDIR>/fabm -DFABM_ERSEM_BASE=<SOURCEDIR>/ersem
    make install

In the above, replace `<SOURCEDIR>` with the directory where you ran "git clone".

If you experience NetCDF issues when running `make install`, see
[tips and tricks/troubleshooting](#tips-and-trickstroubleshooting).

Now you should have a GOTM executable with FABM and ERSEM support at
`~/local/gotm/bin/gotm`.

To use GOTM with ERSEM, copy an ERSEM configuration (recommended:
`testcases/fabm-ersem-15.06-L4-ben-docdyn-iop.yaml`) to your GOTM setup
directory. This file needs to be named `fabm.yaml`. You also need to prescribe
two additional forcing variables: atmospheric pCO2 (in ppm) and light
absorption by sediment (1/m). This can be done in `gotm.yaml` under the `fabm`
section, by adding something like:

    input:
      mole_fraction_of_carbon_dioxide_in_air: 411.29
      absorption_of_silt: 0.07

It is good practice to keep up to date with the latest code from the ERSEM, FABM
and GOTM repositories by regularly running `git pull` in all directories under
`<SOURCEDIR>`.

If the ERSEM, FABM or GOTM source codes change (e.g., because you made changes
to the code yourself or ran `git pull`), you need to recompile. This does *not*
require rerunning cmake. Instead, return to the build directory and rerun `make
install`. For instance `cd ~/build/gotm && make install`.

### fabm0d: ERSEM in an aquarium

FABM's 0d driver allows you to run biogeochemical models in a "well-mixed box"
under arbitrary (time-varying) environmental forcing.

To build the 0d driver, you need to create a directory to build the code in,
run `cmake` to generate makefiles, and call `make` to compile and install.
Usually, the following suffices for this:

    mkdir -p ~/build/fabm-0d
    cd ~/build/fabm-0d
    cmake <SOURCEDIR>/fabm/src/drivers/0d -DGOTM_BASE=<SOURCEDIR>/gotm -DFABM_ERSEM_BASE=<SOURCEDIR>/ersem
    make install

In the above, replace `<SOURCEDIR>` with the directory where you ran
"git clone". NB GOTM is needed because the 0d driver uses GOTM routines for
input, output, time integration, etc. If you experience issues related to
NetCDF, see [tips and tricks/troubleshooting](#tips-and-trickstroubleshooting).

This will give you an executable at `~/local/fabm/0d/bin/fabm0d`.

To use the driver, you need a configuration file can run.nml, which you could
take from `<SOURCEDIR>/fabm/testcases/0d/run.nml`. In addition, you need a file
with forcing data for surface shortwave radiation, temperature and salinity,
e.g., `<SOURCEDIR>/fabm/testcases/0d/env_nns_annual.dat`. The local name of this
file is configured in `run.nml`, variable `env_file`. Finally, you can provide
additional forcing with a `input.yaml` file, which can contain entries such as

    wind_speed:
      file: wind.dat
      column: 1
      scale_factor: 1.0
    absorption_of_silt:
      constant_value: 0.07
    mole_fraction_of_carbon_dioxide_in_air:
      constant_value: 411.29
    bottom_stress:
      constant_value: 0.0

This specifies that wind speed must be read from file wind.dat (first column, no
scaling), the light absorption by silt must be set to a constant value of
0.07 m-1, atmospheric pCO2 to 411.29 ppm, and bottom stress to 0 Pa. The
"column" and "scale_factor" attributes in the case of wind_speed are optional.
They default to 1 and 1.0, respectively.

### Python front-end

The Python front-end ("pyfabm") can be used for enumerating model metadata
(e.g., variable information), to add documentation to fabm.yaml files, or to
retrieve sources-sinks and diagnostics while manipulating the environment.

To build pyfabm, you need to create a directory to build the code in, call
`cmake` to generate makefiles, and call `make` to compile and install the FABM
library. Usually, the following suffices for this:

    mkdir -p ~/build/fabm-python
    cd ~/build/fabm-python
    cmake <SOURCEDIR>/fabm/src/drivers/python -DFABM_ERSEM_BASE=<SOURCEDIR>/ersem
    make install

In the above, replace `<SOURCEDIR>` with the directory where you ran "git clone".

This will install the python-fabm module in a directory that is automatically
looked in by Python. Typically, this is `~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages`
(with X.Y being Python's version number). This means you can now just open
Python and enter `import pyfabm` to load FABM's Python module.

Example Jupyter notebooks that use the Python front-end can be found in
`<FABMDIR>/testcases/python`. More examples can be found on [the FABM wiki](
https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm/wiki/python).

### NEMO + FABM + ERSEM

This requires a customised NEMO codebase with the FABM coupler integrated. To
obtain access to this code, please [register](
https://pml.ac.uk/Modelling_at_PML/Access_Code).

FABM-ERSEM needs to be compiled separately before the compilation of NEMO.
Usually, the following suffices for this:

    mkdir -p ~/build/nemo
    cd ~/build/nemo
    cmake <SOURCEDIR>/fabm -DFABM_HOST=nemo -DFABM_ERSEM_BASE=<SOURCEDIR>/ersem
    make install

This will create the library in the standard folder `~/local/fabm/nemo/lib`
where NEMO-FABM will look for linking to NEMO. Module files (.mod) are placed at
`~/local/fabm/nemo/include`.

### Tips and tricks/troubleshooting

General:

* cmake autodetects a suitable Fortran compiler. If a Fortran compiler is not
  found or you are unhappy with the compiler cmake selected, you can override
  this by providing cmake with `-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=<COMPILER_EXECUTABLE>`.
  Note: if you change `CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER` (or provide it for the first time,
  while you previously ran cmake without), you need to empty your build
  directory first!
* When building GOTM or FABM's 0d driver, cmake will try to auto-detect NetCDF
  using `nf-config`. If nf-config is not present on your system, you'll need to
  provide cmake with the path(s) to the NetCDF include directories
  (`-DNetCDF_INCLUDE_DIRS=<PATH>`) and the path(s) to the NetCDF libraries
  (`-DNetCDF_LIBRARIES=<PATH>`). If you need to provide multiple paths to these
  variables, the individual paths should be separated by semi-colons. A common
  reason to use this: On some systems, `nf-config` does not detect where
  `netcdf.mod` is installed, which means you have to tell cmake by adding
  `-DNetCDF_INCLUDE_DIRS=<netcdf.mod_DIR>`. For instance, when using
  gfortran on Fedora, `<netcdf.mod_DIR>` can be
  `/usr/lib64/gfortran/modules`. In that case you usually do not need to provide
  `-DNetCDF_LIBRARIES=<PATH>`. Also, on some systems (like in the current LTS
  release of Ubuntu), `nf-config` is not included in the NetCDF packages. In this
  case, you can use `nc-config`: specify `-DNetCDF_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=<PATH_TO_nc-config>`
  when calling cmake, or create a link to `nc-config` somewhere in your default
  path, to get auto-detection working.
* By default, cmake will select the "release" build type, which creates an
  executable without debugging information. If you want to compile in debug mode,
  specify `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug` in the call to cmake. When using gfortran,
  you may also want to add `-DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS_DEBUG=-fcheck=bounds` to catch
  out-of-bounds array access.
* To see the settings you specified when you ran cmake, and to selectively make
  changes to these setttings, you can run `ccmake .` in your build directory.
* To speed up compilation, you can perform a parallel build by providing the
  `-j N` switch to `make` (not `cmake`!), with `N` being the number of cores you
  want to use.

Specific platforms:

* [ARCHER](https://www.archer.ac.uk): make sure to first load the cmake and
  cray-netcdf modules (`module load cmake cray-netcdf`). These enable cmake and
  autodetection of NetCDF paths, respectively. Provide
  `-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ftn` to cmake to make sure cmake uses Cray's
  compiler wrapper script for Fortran compilation. Compilation should succeed
  with all three programming environments (intel, gnu, cray).
* Ubuntu LTS: `nf-config` is not included in the netcdf packages, but
  `nc-config` is. Specify `-DNetCDF_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=<PATH_TO_nc-config>` when
  calling cmake, or create a link from `nf-config` to `nc-config` somewhere in
  your default path to get auto-detection of NetCDF paths working.
* Fedora: `nf-config` does not detect where `netcdf.mod` is installed (typically
  in `/usr/lib64/gfortran/modules`). This means you have to tell cmake by adding
  `-DNetCDF_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/lib64/gfortran/modules`.

## Windows

Note: below are quick-start instructions tailored to Visual Studio. Further
information, including instruction for building with the free MinGW compiler,
can be found on [the FABM wiki](http://fabm.net/wiki), section "Building and
installing".

NB this was tested with Visual Studio 2017 in combination with Intel Visual
Fortran 19.

To obtain the source code of GOTM, FABM and ERSEM, you need a git client. First
install [the Windows version of git itself](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
For convenience, you can install the graphical git client [TortoiseGit](
https://tortoisegit.org/) on top; the following instructions assume you have
installed TortoiseGit.

After these two program are installed, you can obtain the code by right-clicking
in Windows Explorer within a directory where you want the source code
directories, and choosing "Git Clone...". In the window that appears, set the
URL, ensure "recursive" is checked and click OK. Do this for the following URLs:

* ERSEM: https://github.com/pmlmodelling/ersem.git
* FABM: https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm.git
* GOTM: https://github.com/gotm-model/code.git (also change `code` to `gotm`
  for the target directory)

To compile the code, you need [CMake](https://www.cmake.org/). If CMake is
installed, open "CMake (cmake-gui)", specify the directory with GOTM code for
"Where is the source code", choose an empty directory of your choice for
"Where to build the binaries", and click Configure. Choose the generator that
matches your Visual Studio version and click Finish. Several configuration
options will appear, among which `FABM_BASE`. This option must be set to the
directory with the FABM source code. After doing so, click "Configure". Then a
new option `FABM_ERSEM_BASE` will appear, which must be set to the path to the
directory with ERSEM source code. Keep clicking "Configure" until there are no
red-coloured options left. Then press "Generate". This will create a `gotm.sln`
Visual Studio solution in the specified build directory, which you can now open
with Visual Studio.

It is good practice to keep up to date with the latest code from the GOTM, FABM
and ERSEM repositories by regularly right-clicking each repository directory,
choosing "Git Sync...", and clicking the "Pull" button in the window that then
appears.

# Migrating from an earlier ERSEM version

If you were using an earlier release of ERSEM, you can update your old ERSEM
configuration (`fabm.yaml`) to the latest by running the Python script
`<SOURCEDIR>/ersem/testcases/update.py` with one argument: the path to your old
fabm.yaml file.

This script requires a recent version of Python 2 or 3 and the [PyYAML package](
https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML). Ideally, you also have the latest version of
[the Python front end to FABM-ERSEM](#python-front-end) installed; this enables
the update script to clean up the yaml file and add documentation to it.
