Over the years, ERSEM has been developed using funding from a wide variety of
sources and projects. The current codebase was developed in the NERC/Defra Shelf
Seas Biogeochemistry 
`Grant: [NE/K001876/1] <https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FK001876%2F1>`__ 
and Marine Ecosystems Research Programmes 
`Grant: [NE/L003066/1] <https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FL003066%2F1>`__.
Today, ERSEM maintenance and development continues to be funded through the NERC
Climate Linked Atlantic Sector Science programme 
`Grant [NE/R015953/1] <https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FR015953%2F1>`__ 
and a combination of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and European Research 
Council (ERC) funded research projects.
