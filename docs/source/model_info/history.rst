The History of ERSEM
####################
 
The European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model, ERSEM, was initially developed 
in two projects, funded by the EU Marine Science and Technology programme 
(ERSEM, 1990-1993; ERSEM II, 1993-1996) both under the leadership of Job 
Baretta at NIOZ (NL). In addition to NIOZ, these initial projects involved 
Plymouth Marine Laboratory (UK), the Universities of Oldenburg (DE), Hamburg 
(DE), Strathclyde (UK) and Aberdeen (UK), Marine Laboratory Aberdeen, 
Ecological Modelling Centre (DK) and CEAB (ES). 
 
The earlier ambitions of the program were significant, not only coupling 
benthic and pelagic processes in a physical context and developing a 
prognostic model, but extending up the food chain to age-structured 
mesozooplankton models, pelagic and demersal fish and even seabirds. 
As a general rule, the higher the trophic level the less successful 
the models as 20+ years ago understanding, data and computational power 
were far inferior to that which we currently enjoy.  
 
Although ERSEM itself had roots in earlier modelling initiatives (the 
Ems-Dollard and Gembase models) it pioneered a community approach to model 
development. At the heart of this was a set of scripts (SESAME) which controlled 
compilation and output generation, data transfer by COMMON BLOCK, a system 
of code nomenclature (:cite:`Blackford1995`, if you are wondering why variables 
and parameters have strange names) and a structure of almost independent 
modules. This meant that for the majority of developers, with minimal practice, 
the code was accessible with limited computational expertise. Development of modules 
could occur in parallel without worrying about interfaces between functional groups. 
This accessibility did not lead to the most efficient coding but did allow a 
range of computationally naive experts the unfettered ability to develop the model. A 
six monthly development cycle, whereby new modules were submitted for assessment 
and incorporation ahead of a project meeting to evaluate results ensured 
rapid model development. Computational  An early schematic of ERSEM 
incompatibility was avoided by providing each partner with the same UNIX computer 
system, the then eye-wateringly expensive SUN SPARC desktops retailing at Â£20K apiece. 
Just a few years previously, before the internet, email and processing capability 
exceeding 100 MHz ERSEM would have been inconceivable.  
 
Each of the initial ERSEM projects produced a special issue describing model systems and 
results, the Netherlands Journal of Sea Research V33 (3/4) in 1995 and the by then renamed 
Journal of Sea Research V38 (3/4) in 1997. After cessation of the ERSEM projects model 
development occurred more independently in three main centres, NIOZ and PML producing 
variants using the ERSEM name and at Bologna where ERSEM formed the basis of the 
Biogeochemical Flux Model (BFM). We suspect that in excess of 200 papers have been 
published using ERSEM since 1995. 
 
The ERSEM model now aspires to reach beyond its name, addressing biogeochemical and 
ecological systems in many applications in global regional seas and more recently the global 
ocean, engaging in a range of heuristic, predictive and impact studies.
